| Summary
This file tells how to install Xiki.  See README.txt for a description of Xiki.

| Steps
- 1: Install EmacsRuby (el4r)
  - See: http://www.rubyist.net/~rubikitch/computer/el4r/index.en.html
    - Click on 'Download / Install / Setup' link
    - These were the commands to run as of 2008-10-04, but be sure to check for updates:

      ruby -ropen-uri -e 'URI("http://www.rubyist.net/~rubikitch/archive/el4r-1.0.4.tar.gz").read.display' > el4r-1.0.4.tar.gz
      tar xzf el4r-1.0.4.tar.gz
      cd el4r-1.0.4
      ruby setup.rb
      ruby -S el4r-rctool -p
      ruby -S el4r-rctool -i

- 2: Get Xiki from github
  - Go to: http://github.com/trogdoro/xiki
  - Option 1: Download as zip
    - Click on the 'download' button
  - Option 2: Clone from git
    - git clone git@github.com:trogdoro/xiki.git

- 3: Require Xiki in EmacsRuby's config
  - Sample configuration
    - /home/hasselhoff/.el4r/
      - init.rb
        | $LOAD_PATH.unshift "/projects/xiki"
        | require 'xiki'
        | KeyBindings.keys   # Use default key bindings
        | Styles.use_xiki_color_scheme   # Use xiki's color scheme

- 4: Install dependant packages
  $ sudo gem install ParseTree net-ssh

| Trouble-shooting
- If you get an error (and you probably will)
  - Restart emacs (or reload .emacs) and look at the log
    - Named something like: /tmp/el4r......log
  - Go to the end and search backward for the last error
    - probably contains ":Error:"

- If you got partially through the load
  - you will be able to use these keys to trouble-shoot:
    - M-l to reload xiki and .emacs
      - also use this when you see "el4r-instance is dead"
    - M-e to look at the latest error

- If you get a "can't find header dir for ruby" error
  $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.8-dev
